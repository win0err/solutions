# Find Intersection

Have the function `findIntersection(strArr)` read the array of strings stored in strArr which will contain 2 elements: the first element will represent a list of comma-separated numbers sorted in ascending order, the second element will represent a second list of comma-separated numbers (also sorted). Your goal is to return a comma-separated string containing the numbers that occur in elements of strArr in sorted order. If there is no intersection, return the string false.
