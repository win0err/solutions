# Palindrome

Have the function `palindrome(str)` take the `str` parameter being passed and return the `true` if the parameter is a palindrome, (the string is the same forward as it is backward) otherwise return the `false`. For example: "racecar" is also "racecar" backwards. Punctuation and numbers will not be part of the string.
